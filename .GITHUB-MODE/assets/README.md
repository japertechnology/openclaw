# GitHub Mode assets

Static assets used by GitHub Mode documentation and validation tooling live here.

## Contents

- `logo.png`: branding image used in `.GITHUB-MODE/README.md`.
- `github-mode-required-packages.json`: package allow/requirement list consumed by package validation checks.

## Editing guidance

- Keep assets deterministic and reviewable.
- Prefer text-based assets (like JSON manifests) for policy-driven checks.
- If you replace binary assets, include a short note in the PR about why the replacement is needed.
