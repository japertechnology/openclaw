## What belongs here

- Tradeoff analysis (cost, performance, and operational model).
- Concept notes and framing documents.
- Deep dives that support planning and ADR decisions.

## How this differs from other docs

- Use `docs/adr/` for final architecture decisions.
- Use `docs/planning/` for roadmap and execution plans.
- Use this folder for investigations and rationale inputs that may evolve over time.

## Maintenance notes

- Keep file names descriptive.
- Link from planning/ADR docs when an analysis is an input to a decision.
- If an analysis is superseded, update it with a short “superseded by” note instead of deleting context.
