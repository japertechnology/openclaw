# OpenClaw GitHub Mode

## Document Purpose

This document defines a **high-fidelity GitHub Runtime Plane** for OpenClaw that can run substantial assistant behavior from repository commits and workflows, while preserving the existing installed/runtime experience on user devices.

It is a product and architecture spec, not an implementation checklist (that lives in `.GITHUB-MODE-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`).

---

## 1) Why GitHub Mode Exists

OpenClaw already ships a broad assistant runtime:

- Multi-channel messaging surfaces (core + extension channels)
- Agent orchestration (`src/auto-reply/reply`, `src/agents/pi-embedded-runner`)
- Tooling and policy gates (`src/agents/tools`, `src/agents/pi-tools.ts`, `src/agents/tool-policy.ts`)
- CLI-first operations plus gateway/web/app control surfaces
- Safety, routing, pairing/allowlist, and model failover behavior

GitHub mode exists to bring this runtime into repository workflows so teams can:

- validate behavior contracts and policy changes continuously
- run replay/eval/cost checks from source control
- execute trusted command-driven automation
- generate durable outputs (issues, PRs, attestations, artifacts)
- promote with approvals and auditable evidence

### 1.1 Core Principle

**Reuse OpenClaw core paths first; add GitHub-specific adapters only where host constraints require them.**

### 1.2 Hard Constraint

**No installed-runtime regressions are allowed.** GitHub mode is additive.

---

## 2) Runtime Planes and Boundaries

### 2.1 Installed Runtime Plane (existing, unchanged)

OpenClaw installed on macOS/Linux/Windows (WSL), with long-lived gateway and channel sessions, keeps all current behavior:

- persistent channel connections/sockets
- local hardware/node features (camera/mic/location/screen/system actions)
- app-level integrations (macOS menu bar app, iOS/Android node flows)
- existing onboarding, pairing, and allowlist safety paths

### 2.2 GitHub Runtime Plane (new)

OpenClaw executes from repo state in GitHub Actions/Environments:

- pull request checks and simulations
- issue/PR comment command workflows
- scheduled drift/eval monitoring
- policy-gated bot PRs
- approval-gated promotions with attestations

### 2.3 Explicit non-goals for initial rollout

- replacing installed always-on channel session handling
- directly exposing device-bound hardware actions in untrusted workflows
- bypassing GitHub security primitives with custom secret infrastructure

---

## 3) Functional Coverage Model

Every installed feature is classified in `runtime/github/parity-matrix.json` as one of:

- `native`: runs unchanged in GitHub mode
- `adapter`: same semantics via a GitHub-safe adapter
- `emulated`: replay/mock harness with measured fidelity
- `installed-only`: explicitly out of GitHub scope (for now)

### 3.1 Coverage targets

1. Maximize `native + adapter` for high-value paths.
2. Use `emulated` for deterministic replay where persistence/device constraints exist.
3. Keep `installed-only` narrow, documented, and owner-assigned.

### 3.2 Initial high-value parity priorities

1. orchestration and tool-policy flow
2. routing and policy behavior contracts
3. eval/regression and cost envelopes
4. command-to-PR automation lifecycle
5. promotion/attestation/incident governance

---

## 4) Architecture

### 4.1 Shared runtime spine

GitHub mode reuses these core modules:

- `src/auto-reply/reply`
- `src/agents/pi-embedded-runner`
- `src/agents/pi-tools.ts`
- `src/agents/tools/*`
- `src/routing/*`

### 4.2 GitHub overlay components

### Ingress

- `issue_comment`
- `pull_request_review_comment` / PR comment surfaces
- `workflow_dispatch`
- `schedule`
- (trusted) `repository_dispatch` and `workflow_call`

### Runtime

- same orchestration/agent loop
- trust-aware command parsing
- policy-gated tool activation

### Adapters

- patch-planning + repository write adapters
- docs/diagram generation adapters
- route/policy simulation adapters
- replay/memory/channel emulation adapters

### Egress

- checks/statuses
- workflow summaries
- artifacts (machine + human readable)
- issue/PR comments
- bot branches/PRs
- attestations

---

## 5) Repository Contracts

GitHub mode uses repository-native contracts as control surfaces:

- `routing/`
- `policies/`
- `agents/`
- `datasets/`
- `eval/`
- `attestations/`
- `docs/ai/`
- `runtime/github/` (GitHub mode contracts)

### 5.1 Required `runtime/github/` artifacts

- `runtime-manifest.json`
- `adapter-contracts.json`
- `command-policy.json`
- `trust-levels.json`
- `parity-matrix.json`
- `workspace-convergence-map.json`

Schemas are versioned and validated in CI.

---

## 6) Multi-Entity Template Model

GitHub mode must support creating **multiple OpenClaw entities** in one user/org account with repeatable scaffold and safe collaboration.

Each entity repo must define (Phase 6 deliverables; not yet implemented):

- `runtime/github/entity-manifest.json`
- `runtime/github/collaboration-policy.json`
- `runtime/github/remote-entities.json`

### 6.1 Bootstrap baseline

Every entity template includes:

- issue forms
- PR templates
- labels
- CODEOWNERS
- branch protection expectations
- environment placeholders and required secrets/variables docs
- baseline GitHub-mode workflows in known-good state

### 6.2 Collaboration envelope requirements

Cross-entity messages must include:

- source entity id
- target entity id
- intent/command type
- source commit SHA + run id
- trust level + policy version
- correlation id
- created timestamp + ttl

Collaboration is deny-by-default: only allowlisted routes in collaboration policy can execute.

---

## 7) Security Model (GitHub-native)

### 7.1 Control requirements

- secrets only via GitHub Secrets / Environment Secrets
- non-sensitive config via Variables
- no secrets in logs/artifacts/cache keys/workflow inputs
- no secret access for untrusted fork PR contexts
- explicit least-privilege `permissions:` on every workflow/job
- third-party actions pinned by full commit SHA
- OIDC federation preferred over static cloud credentials
- protected branches cannot be written directly by bots

### 7.2 Trust tiers

- **Untrusted**: forks/unknown actors; read-only and constrained adapters only
- **Semi-trusted**: internal PR contexts; moderate capabilities, no production mutation
- **Trusted**: maintainers/approved env; privileged command and promotion paths

Command authorization occurs before any privileged tool execution.

## 8) Workflow Portfolio

### 8.1 Validation and simulation

- `github-mode-build.yml`
- `github-mode-check.yml`
- `github-mode-test.yml`
- `github-mode-policy.yml`
- `github-mode-route-sim.yml`
- `github-mode-eval-tier0.yml`
- `github-mode-cost.yml`

### 8.2 Conversational and PR automation

- `github-mode-command.yml`
- `github-mode-agent-run.yml`
- `github-mode-bot-pr.yml`

### 8.3 Collaboration and template governance

- `github-mode-bootstrap-entity.yml`
- `github-mode-sync-templates.yml`
- `github-mode-collab-dispatch.yml`
- `github-mode-collab-receive.yml`

### 8.4 Promotion and operations

- `github-mode-promote-dev.yml`
- `github-mode-promote-staging.yml`
- `github-mode-promote-prod.yml`
- `github-mode-drift.yml`
- `github-mode-incident.yml`

---

## 9) Attestation and Promotion

Every promotion emits a tamper-evident attestation with at least:

- commit/environment
- policy/routing/agent revisions
- model ids + dataset hashes
- eval summary + cost budget result
- approvers + timestamp
- artifact/run references

Promotion gates require green validation + explicit environment approvals.

---

## 10) Observability and Governance

GitHub mode produces standardized summaries/artifacts for:

- parity score trends
- workflow reliability/flakiness
- command throughput and bot PR acceptance
- collaboration success/failure and latency
- policy/security violations
- promotion lead time and rollback time

All metrics are reproducible from commit + artifacts.

---

## 11) Success Criteria

GitHub mode is successful when all of the following are true:

1. Installed runtime behavior remains unchanged under regression suite.
2. High-value OpenClaw paths run in GitHub mode through shared core modules.
3. Security posture is fully enforced by GitHub native controls.
4. Command-driven automation produces auditable, policy-governed PR outputs.
5. Promotions are approval-gated and backed by valid attestations.
6. Parity matrix is maintained and trending upward.
7. Template-generated entities can safely collaborate via governed GitHub-native channels.

This preserves OpenClaw's local-first installed experience while making repository-native operations first-class.
